    "# Template Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Template Matching is a method for searching and finding the location of a template image in a larger image. OpenCV comes with a function cv2.matchTemplate() for this purpose. It simply slides the template image over the input image (as in 2D convolution) and compares the template and patch of input image under the template image. Several comparison methods are implemented in OpenCV. (You can check docs for more details). It returns a grayscale image, where each pixel denotes how much does the neighbourhood of that pixel match with template.\n",
    "\n",
    "If input image is of size (WxH) and template image is of size (wxh), output image will have a size of (W-w+1, H-h+1). Once you got the result, you can use cv2.minMaxLoc() function to find where is the maximum/minimum value. Take it as the top-left corner of rectangle and take (w,h) as width and height of the rectangle. That rectangle is your region of template.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Template Matching with Multiple Objects: Suppose you are searching for an object which has multiple occurances, cv2.minMaxLoc() won’t give you all the locations. In that case, we will use thresholding."

    "# Hough Line Transform - cv2.HoughLines()\n",
    "The Hough transform is a technique which can be used to isolate features of a particular shape within an image. Because it requires that the desired features be specified in some parametric form, the classical Hough transform is most commonly used for the detection of regular curves such as lines, circles, ellipses, etc. A generalized Hough transform can be employed in applications where a simple analytic description of a feature(s) is not possible. Due to the computational complexity of the generalized Hough algorithm, we restrict the main focus of this discussion to the classical Hough transform. Despite its domain restrictions, the classical Hough transform (hereafter referred to without the classical prefix) retains many applications, as most manufactured parts (and many anatomical parts investigated in medical imagery) contain feature boundaries which can be described by regular curves. The main advantage of the Hough transform technique is that it is tolerant of gaps in feature boundary descriptions and is relatively unaffected by image noise.\n",

    "# Image Segmentation with Watershed Algorithm - cv2.watershed()\n",
    "\n",
    "Any grayscale image can be viewed as a topographic surface where high intensity denotes peaks and hills while low intensity denotes valleys. You start filling every isolated valleys (local minima) with different colored water (labels). As the water rises, depending on the peaks (gradients) nearby, water from different valleys, obviously with different colors will start to merge. To avoid that, you build barriers in the locations where water merges. You continue the work of filling water and building barriers until all the peaks are under water. Then the barriers you created gives you the segmentation result. This is the “philosophy” behind the watershed. You can visit the CMM webpage on watershed to understand it with the help of some animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this approach gives you oversegmented result due to noise or any other irregularities in the image. So OpenCV implemented a marker-based watershed algorithm where you specify which are all valley points are to be merged and which are not. It is an interactive image segmentation. What we do is to give different labels for our object we know. Label the region which we are sure of being the foreground or object with one color (or intensity), label the region which we are sure of being background or non-object with another color and finally the region which we are not sure of anything, label it with 0. That is our marker. Then apply watershed algorithm. Then our marker will be updated with the labels we gave, and the boundaries of objects will have a value of -1.\n"

    "# Interactive Foreground Extraction using GrabCut Algorithm\n",

    "GrubCut was created for foreground extraction with minimal user interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "How it works from user point of view ? Initially user draws a rectangle around the foreground region (foreground region shoule be completely inside the rectangle). Then algorithm segments it iteratively to get the best result. Done. But in some cases, the segmentation won’t be fine, like, it may have marked some foreground region as background and vice versa. In that case, user need to do fine touch-ups. Just give some strokes on the images where some faulty results are there. Strokes basically says “Hey, this region should be foreground, you marked it background, correct it in next iteration” or its opposite for background. Then in the next iteration, you get better results."
